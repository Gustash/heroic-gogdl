# heroic-gogdl

GOG download module for [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher)


## Purpose
This will take care of downloading games from GOG in Heroic.


# TODO LIST:
- check if there are games that still use V1 depots and have DLCs downloadable
- return meta Etag when downloading games, to check for updates in the future

## Great resources about GOG API
